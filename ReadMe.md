# BlackJack
##your planning github repo should include these things on its README.md (you can make this file on your computer):
The name of your game
rules of your game (how do you win? how do you lose?)
wireframes (photos of how the game would look)
pseudocode of how the game would work in JavaScript
helpful links (websites about your game, useful resources you would like to use or learn about, etc.)
you can follow this guide to make a well-formatted Readme using Markdown, the language of .md!
